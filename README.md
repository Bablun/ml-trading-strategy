# ml-trading-strategy
Trading strategy of High Frequency Data using ML (Classification)

* Introduction

The ultimate goal of this project is to implement an end-to-end trading strategy using machine learning.
This deliverable contains the modeling part of the final project of WQU Machine Learning in Finance Course (check the program for more details here https://wqu.org). The project will apply an investment strategy using classification.

* Files included in this project

 - README: this file
 - model.ipynb: notebook of the model solution with thorough discussion and conclusions

* Data:

S&P500 E-Mini tick data

* Results:

All the results are discussed in the notebook
 
* Requirements (python)

This python script has been written to be run using Python 3.6. 
TA-Lib: see http://ta-lib.org/ for instructions on the installation

* Recommended modules

The key modules required for this project are the following:

re 2.2.1
json 2.0.9
pandas 0.22.0
pandas_datareader 0.7.0
numpy 1.15.2
sklearn 0.19.1
statsmodels 0.8.0
scipy 1.0.1
matplotlib 2.2.2
seaborn 0.8.1
talib 0.4.17

* Installation

Most of the above key modules can be installed in Anaconda except ta-lib (look at the project's webpage)
The cleanest way to proceed would be to create an environment with the required modules.
See more info on how to create environments here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
All the libraries can be installed using pip within the env:

pip install <name of module>

* Configuration

No much configuration is required if the above installations have successfully processed

* Troubleshooting

Problems may occur due to not importing all required modules keying in invalid ticker.

* FAQ

Refer to the website of each of the main modules and GOOGLE for general FAQ on the functionality of each feature in the program
